        </h2>
        <p>Best known for his poems and short fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, born in Boston, Jan. 19, 1809, died Oct. 7, 1849
            in Baltimore, deserves more credit than any other writer for the transformation of the short story from
            anecdote to art. He virtually created the detective story and perfected the psychological thriller. He also
            produced some of the most influential literary criticism of his time -- important theoretical statements on
            poetry and the short story -- and has had a worldwide influence on literature.</p>
        <p>He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts; his parents died when he was young. Poe was taken in by
            John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short
            period at the University of Virginia and briefly attempting a military career, Poe parted ways with the
            Allans. Poe's publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other
            Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian".</p>
